Disclaimer: Blockchain technologies are constantly evolving. This paper describes the best possible planned development, however due to the nature of the technology and the complexity of integrating the world of blockchain. This document may be subject to change. We try to come as close as possible to the original plan, but sometimes modifications are necessary to improve the user experience and overcome technological barriers encountered during development. 1. Introduction The digital divide began several years ago and the world is gradually becoming digitalized. The majority of payments are now made online and more and more digital products are being purchased. However, ownership of these goods rarely belongs to the buyers. The digital games that you have on your Steam account, PS store or others platforms do not really belong to you. The advent of NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) has revolutionized digital goods and allows for true ownership within the blockchain. The NFTs belong to you and you are free to dispose of them as you want. However, the sale, purchase or exchange of NFTs is unfortunately not available to everyone yet. Between the difficulty of using the various marketplace and the increasing cost of gas fees, NFTs have become reserved for the medium and large wallet. With the arrival of utility NFTs (in video games for example) it has become crucial to transform the way we exchange NFTs to make them easily accessible to everyone, both in terms of usage and associated costs. Galital was born out of this observation. An ecosystem to democratize the use of NFTs by creating an NFT platform based on Polkadot and the framework substrate. The development of Galital is based on several essential components: The Factory Making the creation and deployment of NFTs simple, fast and accessible to artists, content creators, video game creators or anyone else. The Hub Allow the interconnection of NFTs between different chains, whether it is to The Binance Chain, Ethereum, Avax, Polkadot or Flare, the goal of the Hub is to make the cross-chain transition simple and accessible. The Market Real main component of the ecosystem, the market allows the sale, purchase or exchange of NFTs, whether by auction or simple listing. Users also have the possibility to exchange NFTs directly. Finally, thanks to DeFi, the market allows NFTs to be borrowed and lent. The Forge The domain of Sharding. This is the place where the magic happens and allows the user to break their NFT into multiple sharded parts. This is also where you can reform an NFT with all its sharded parts. The Vault allows you to place your NFTs as collateral in order to retrieve tokens. The Home A dashboard to manage your NFTs. 2. Governance and Treasury Galital is based on the substrate framework, so it benefits from a true decentralized governance system built directly within the blockchain itself. Among other things, it allows any $TAL holder to have a voice in the evolution of the ecosystem. Through governance, it is possible to submit proposals to help Galital evolve, submit bounty to direct the development of different products or even to offer tips to reward the work done by the community. Governance is divided into 3 distinct groups: The technical committee ensures the stability and safety of the blockchain. They are therefore able to submit emergency motions to council, once validated by the council, these motions apply in a shorter time frame than the classic motions. This chamber is reserved for members with an excellent knowledge of the blockchain and the Galital source code. Council members vote on motions and expenditures of the treasury (mission / tip). Their role is central and their mission is to make the ecosystem evolve by validating the proposals made by the community. They are elected by the community and their mandate currently lasts 7 days. The seats on the council are open and any $TAL holder can submit his candidacy. Holders of $TAL can vote to elect council members, make proposals to improve the blockchain, propose missions or carry out missions. They are the heart of Galital and it is thanks to them that the ecosystem evolves and moves forward. It is thanks to this governance system that Galital users can have a strong impact in the evolution of the ecosystem. It is no longer a single entity that has the power, but the entire community. In order to support the different evolutions of the blockchain, the treasury is a crucial mechanism allowing Galital to support itself without the help of a third party. It essentially allows the community to be able to set up remunerated missions to develop new products, do marketing, add new bridges or any other proposal deemed relevant by the members of the board and validated by the community. 3. Initial tokens allocation 4. Placement and security of the chain (Staking) Any holder of $TAL can participate in the staking to secure the blockchain. In return for this contribution, staker will receive $TAL rewards. There are 2 distinct roles: Validator and Nominator . 4.1 Validator Validator secure the chain by locking $TAL and processing blocks and transactions, they are backed by a stake from the validator owner and the nominater that stake on top of the validator. These will play a crucial role in the addition of new blocks to the relay chain and, by extension, to all secondary chains. This will allow the parties to carry out inter-chain transactions via the relay chain. Validator have 2 functions: They verify the information contained in an assigned set of blocks from substrings to determine their validity (such as the identity of the parties to the transaction and the subject matter of the contract). They participate in consensus mechanisms to produce the building blocks of the chain based on the validity statements of the other validator. In the case of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms, the validator is slashed by removing some or all of the $TAL locked on it. This mechanism thus helps to discourage bellicose actors. Conversely, respect and good performance are rewarded by the blockchain. There are currently 500 places available for validator. In order to be elected by the network and thus create new blocks, validator must be in the first 500 in terms of $TAL blocked (validator + nominations). If a validator is not elected by the network, they will not do any work and will not receive any reward. In return for their contribution, validators receive the block rewards (new $TAL created, based on the inflation system provided by the network) as well as 20% of the transaction fee (the rest going to the treasury). These rewards are divided between the validator and its nominators according to their respective shares (minus the commission set by the validator to cover maintenance costs). 4.2 Nominator The nominators are responsible for designating their participation to the validators. By locking their $TAL on validators, they allow validators to be selected by the network to create new blocks and share the associated rewards and penalties. While validators are active participants in the network who take part in the production and finality mechanisms of the blocks, nominators play a more passive role with a delegation approach. Therefore, there is no need for technical knowledge or specific equipment. However, a good nominator is wise with regard to the validators he or she chooses, paying attention to his or her own reward percentage and the risk of being sanctioned if the validator acts in a belligerent manner. Nominators are rewarded according to the number of shares they hold in the Validator (less commission fees). 5. The Factory The factory is an essential component of the Galital ecosystem, it allows, among other things, to create and deploy its own NFTs in a simple and fast way. Thanks to an ergonomic interface design, creating NFTs becomes child's play and within everyone's reach. Whether you're an artist, content creator, Video game developer or passionate about NFTs, the factory is made to simplify your life and save you precious time, allowing you to create endless NFTs in a snap of your fingers. It will also be possible, during the creation of an NFT, to choose a % of royalties that will be paid to the creator for each transaction of the said NFT in the Galital market. This system will provide creators with an additional income incentive to share their creations. 6. The Hub (Bridges between chains + IU) The Hub is the dedicated space for cross-chain bridges. This is where users will be able to transfer their NFTs between the different channels supported by Galital (the list will evolve according to the choices of the community). Initially, transfers to and from Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polkadot, Matic and Flare will be available. This will allow the user to freely transfer their NFTs for direct use in the Galital ecosystem, including the market. The transfer and flow is simple, the user will have a graphical user interface where they can select the origin and destination chain for the transfer of NFTs or tokens, the user then signs the transaction through the network of oracles (Galital will use ChainSafe technology), and transfers the assets to the desired chain. 7. The Market The market is Galital's central point, this is where users will be able to buy or sell NFTs. The strength of the market is its simplicity of use and diversity, it will be possible for the seller to choose the crypto he wants to receive as payment and the buyer will be able to pay in the crypto of his choice, thanks to an integrated DEX system, the purchases will be fluid, no more time to convert your ETHs into DAI because the NFT of your choice was only listed in DAI. No more exorbitant gas fees, your purchase is now done in one click and you can then buy your NFTs whenever you want, quickly and easily. At the time of a sale, 2 expenses are deducted from the sale: Market Fees: 2.5%. Creator\u2019s Fees : defined by the creator when creating the NFT. The market fee can be reduced when paying in $TAL as well as in possession of special NFTs. Cumulatively they can even reach a reduction of 100%. However, the creator's fee cannot be reduced. Users also have the possibility to make a private sale (NFT can only be purchased through the address specified by the seller). In this case, only the fees for the creator are deducted. 8. The Vault The vault is the ideal place to stack NFTs to farmer new tokens. Whether you want to earn in-game coins or other crypto tokens, the vault allows you to lock your NFTs for a period of time to make them work for you. 9. Fractional NFT System Galital intends to implement fractional NFT in order to push the NFT beyond the limit and unlock a bunch of new possibilities. Fractional Ownership Fractional NFT allows users to share ownership of NFT\u2019s. You want an epic sword in a game but you can afford it ? Or maybe a Cryptopunk catches your eyes but it\u2019s way too expensive to buy one on your own ? Fractional NFT will allow you to take a share on these NFT\u2019s. It\u2019s even more useful when you want to take advantage of DeFi with NFT. Fractional NFT unlocks you the ability to take fractional part in order to receive an income with the lending system for instance. You will benefit from all the DeFi associated with NFT\u2019s. Fractional NFT system has so many opportunities way beyond this paper. If you\u2019re a mmo gamer, you will definity want to use it to buy NFT as a guild and share ownership between members. Even further, game developers could develop smart contracts that allow guilds to own an NFT and share it with the guild members according to their rank. Thanks to this, you will now can own NFT as a guild, rent it or sell it and the benefit will be shared between all the members. Or you can also simply share an NFT with your friends or your community and use it in game one at the time. This system is a huge step forward for the gaming industry and allows a lot of opportunities to play, own and earn together. Market Price Discovery Sharding will also unlock a better and healthier price discovery for NTFs. Shared parts will be directly driven by the market and traded like any token. If a user wants to take the full ownership of an sharded NFT, it will need to get all the shard parts in order to transform them into the NFT. You can also at any time break an NFT into any shard you want. That allows you to give more scarcity to a single NFT. 10. The forge The forge is the place where users can break their NFT\u2019s into shards. They decide the scarcity (10 shards, 100, 1000 eg...) Then, they can distribute or sell it on the market place like a token. This will unlock the possibility of video game creators to improve the scarcity of their NFT and allow a greater number of people to get into it. When you have collected all the shards from an NFT, you can go on the forge and fuse them in order to retrieve the original NFT. 11. Lending / Borrow In addition to greatly simplifying the buying and selling of NFTs, the market also allows users to rent or lend their NFTs. Want to get a valuable item in a game for a certain period of time? Do you own lands that you would like to make available? A friend needs an NFT in your possession temporarily? The market will allow you to perform all these actions and much more in a simple and secure way. No more need to send your NFT in order to lend it. A new field of possibilities opens up for you with the Galital market. 12. The Home The home acts as a dashboard to manage your NFTs. This is where you will be able to view your NFTs, managing your assets is your main control panel. From here you will be able to manage all applications, create tokens, buy/sell on the marketplace. 13. INK! Contracts Since Substrate supports Wasm smart contracts, this means that any language that can compile to Wasm can be used to write these contracts. ink! is Parity's answer to writing smart contracts using the Rust programming language. ink! is an integrated domain specific language (eDSL) based on Rust for writing intelligent Wasm contracts specifically for \"Pallet Contracts\". The main objectives of INK! are user-friendliness, conciseness and efficiency. 13.1 Contract Components ink! should feel familiar to developers who have programmed using other modern intelligent contract languages. The skeleton of a contract with all the same components you would expect: Events Storage space Deployment function (manufacturer) Public functions Internal functions In ink! mutability and visibility are explicitly defined by contract function. In these functions, you have access to a number of common Substrate types such as AccountId, Scales, Hash, etc. In addition, you have access to commonly used environment variables such as caller ID and more! 13.2 Design The main objectives of ink! are accuracy, conciseness and efficiency. inking! is designed to be as close as possible to the Rust programming language. The language uses attribute macros to mark up standard Rust structures into understandable contract components. Because ink! follows Rust standards, tools like rustfmt and rust-analyzer already work natively. 13.3 Overflow security Being written in Rust, INK! can provide over/underrun security at compile time. Using a Rust compiler configuration, you can specify whether you want to support mathematical overflows or whether you want contract execution to panic in the event of an overflow. There is no need to continually import \"Safe Math\" libraries, although Rust also offers built-in verified, encapsulated, and saturated mathematical functions. Note: There are known issues with the functionality of the compiler overflow checks and the resulting size of the blob Wasm object. This feature may change or be repeated in the future. 13.4 Test environment INK! provides an integrated test environment that can be used to perform out-of-chain unit testing with the Rust framework. This makes it simple and easy to ensure that your contract code works as expected, without the need for third-party test platforms. 13.4 ink! vs Solidity Rust is an ideal intelligent contract language. It is secure, memory-safe, and free of undefined behaviors. It generates small binary files because it doesn't include extra bloat, such as a garbage collector, and advanced optimizations and removes dead code. Using compiler flags, Rust can automatically protect itself against integer overflow. INK! chooses not to invent a new programming language, but rather to adapt a subset of Rust to serve this purpose. As a result, you benefit from all the tools and support available free of charge for the Rust ecosystem. In addition, as the language grows, INK! will automatically have access to new features and functionality, improving the way you can write smart contracts in the future.

Galital: La galaxie digital Clause de non-responsabilit\u00e9: Les technologies de la blockchain et du jeu vid\u00e9o sont en constante \u00e9volution. Ce papier blanc d\u00e9crit le d\u00e9velopement le mieux possible, toutefois du \u00e0 la nature de la technologie et la complexit\u00e9e de l\u2019int\u00e9gration du monde de la blockchain et du jeux vid\u00e9o le pr\u00e9sent document peut \u00eatre sujet \u00e0 des changements. Nous essayons de nous rapprocher au maximum du plan initial, mais parfois des modifications sont n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer l\u2019exp\u00e9rience utilisateur et surmonter les barri\u00e8res technologiques rencontr\u00e9es au cours du d\u00e9veloppement.. 1. Introduction La fracture num\u00e9rique a commenc\u00e9 depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es et le monde tend \u00e0 se digitaliser progressivement. La majorit\u00e9 des paiements se font d\u00e9sormais en ligne et on ach\u00e8te de plus en plus de produits digitaux. Cependant, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces biens n'appartient que rarement aux acheteurs. Les jeux num\u00e9riques que vous avez sur votre compte Steam, PS store ou autres ne vous appartiennent pas r\u00e9ellement. L'arriv\u00e9e des NFT (Non Fongible Token) a r\u00e9volutionn\u00e9 le biens digital et permet une vraie propri\u00e9t\u00e9 au sein de la blockchain. Les NFT vous appartiennent et vous \u00eates libre d\u2019en disposer comme bon vous semble. Cependant, la vente, l\u2019achat ou l'\u00e9change de NFT n\u2019est h\u00e9las pas accessible \u00e0 tout le monde encore. Entre la difficult\u00e9 d\u2019utilisation des diff\u00e9rents marketplace et notamment le co\u00fbt grandissant des frais annexes, les NFT sont devenues r\u00e9serv\u00e9es au moyen et gros portefeuille. Avec l'arriv\u00e9e des NFT utilitaires (dans le jeux vid\u00e9o par exemple) il est devenu crucial de transformer notre fa\u00e7on d'\u00e9changer les NFT afin de les rendre facile d'acc\u00e8s pour tout un chacun, que ce soit sur le plan de l\u2019utilisation que sur les frais associ\u00e9s. C\u2019est sur ce constat qu'est n\u00e9 Galital. Un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me permettant de d\u00e9mocratiser l\u2019utilisation des NFT en cr\u00e9ant une plateforme NFT bas\u00e9e sur Polkadot et le framework substrate. L'\u00e9laboration de Galital repose sur plusieurs composants essentiels : La Factory Rendre la cr\u00e9ation et le d\u00e9ploiement de NFT simple, rapide et accessible aux artistes, cr\u00e9ateurs de contenu, studio de jeux vid\u00e9o ou tout un chacun. Le Hub Permettre l\u2019interconnexion des NFT entre les diff\u00e9rentes cha\u00eenes, que ce soit vers La Binance Chain, Ethereum, Avax, Polkadot ou encore Flare, le but du Hub est de rendre la transition cross-chain simple et accessible. Le Market V\u00e9ritable composant principal de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me, le market permet la vente, l\u2019achat ou l'\u00e9change de NFT, que ce soit via ench\u00e8re ou simple listing. Les utilisateurs ont \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de pouvoir s'\u00e9changer directement des NFT. Enfin, gr\u00e2ce au DeFi, le market permet le borrow et lending de NFT. la Forge Le domaine du Sharding. C'est l'endroit o\u00f9 la magie op\u00e8re et permet de casser ses NFT en plusieurs \u00e9clat ou \"Shard\". C'est \u00e9galement ici que vous pouvez reformer un NFT si vous poss\u00e9dez tout ses \"Shards\". Le Vault Permet de placer ses NFT en collat\u00e9ral afin de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer des Tokens Le Home dashboard permettant de g\u00e9rer ses NFT. L'arcade C'est ici que vous trouverez tous les jeux vid\u00e9o d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s par Galital ainsi que les jeux des autres studios qui utilisent l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Galital. 2. Gouvernance et tr\u00e9sorerie Galital est bas\u00e9 sur le framework substrate, de ce fait, il b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019un vrai syst\u00e8me de gouvernance d\u00e9centralis\u00e9 construit directement au sein de la blockchain elle-m\u00eame. Il permet entre autres \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel d\u00e9tenteur de $TAL de pouvoir faire entendre sa voix dans l'\u00e9volution de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Via la gouvernance, il est possible de soumettre des propositions afin de faire \u00e9voluer Galital, des missions pour permettre de diriger le d\u00e9veloppement des diff\u00e9rents produits ou encore de proposer des pourboires afin de r\u00e9compenser le travail effectu\u00e9 par la communaut\u00e9. La gouvernance se d\u00e9coupe en 3 groupes distinct : Le comit\u00e9 technique assure la stabilit\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la blockchain. Ils sont donc en mesure de soumettre des motions d\u2019urgence aupr\u00e8s du conseil, une fois valid\u00e9s par le conseil, ces motions s'appliquent dans un d\u00e9lai plus court que les motions classiques.Cette chambre est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux membres ayant une excellente connaissance de la blockchain et du code source de Galital. Les membres du conseil votent les motions et les d\u00e9penses de la tr\u00e9sorerie (mission / pourboire). Leur r\u00f4le est central et leur mission est de faire \u00e9voluer l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me en validant les propositions faites par la communaut\u00e9. Ils sont \u00e9lus par la communaut\u00e9 et leur mandat dure 7 jours actuellement. Les si\u00e8ges du conseil sont ouverts et n\u2019importe quel d\u00e9tenteur de $TAL peut soumettre sa candidature. Les d\u00e9tenteurs de $TAL peuvent quant \u00e0 eux voter pour \u00e9lire les membres du conseil, faire des propositions afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la blockchain, proposer des missions ou encore en effectuer. Ils sont le c\u0153ur de Galital et c\u2019est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 eux que l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me \u00e9volue et avance plus loin. C\u2019est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce syst\u00e8me de gouvernance que les utilisateurs de Galital peuvent avoir un impact fort dans l'\u00e9volution de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me. Ce n\u2019est plus une seule entit\u00e9 qui a le pouvoir, mais la communaut\u00e9 toute enti\u00e8re. Afin de supporter les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9volutions de la blockchain, la tr\u00e9sorerie est un m\u00e9canisme crucial permettant \u00e0 Galital de subvenir \u00e0 ses besoins sans l\u2019aide d\u2019un tiers. Elle permet essentiellement \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 de pouvoir mettre en place des missions r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es afin de d\u00e9velopper de nouveaux produits, de faire du marketing, d\u2019ajouter de nouveau bridge ou tout autre proposition jug\u00e9e pertinente par les membres du conseil et valid\u00e9e par la communaut\u00e9. 3. Allocation initiale des tokens 4. Placement et s\u00e9curit\u00e9e de la cha\u00eene (Staking) N\u2019importe quel d\u00e9tenteur de $TAL peux participer au staking afin de s\u00e9curiser la blockchain. En contrepartie de cette contribution, les stakeur re\u00e7oivent des r\u00e9compenses en $TAL. Il existe 2 r\u00f4les distincts : validateur et Nominateur . 4.1 Collateur Les validateurs s\u00e9curisent la cha\u00eene relais en bloquant des $TAL permettant de valider les preuves des collators et en participant au consensus avec les autres validateurs. Ceux-ci joueront un r\u00f4le crucial dans l\u2019ajout de nouveaux blocs a la chaine relais et par extension, \u00e0 toutes les cha\u00eenes secondaires. Cela permettant ainsi aux parties d\u2019effectuer des transactions interchaine via la cha\u00eene relais. Les Validateurs remplissent 2 fonctions: Ils v\u00e9rifient les informations contenues dans un ensemble assign\u00e9 de blocs provenant de cha\u00eenes secondaires afin de d\u00e9terminer leur validit\u00e9 (telles que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des parties de la transaction et l'objet du contrat). Ils participent aux m\u00e9canismes de consensus afin de produire les blocs de la cha\u00eene relais en se basant sur les d\u00e9clarations de validit\u00e9 des autres validateurs. Dans le cas de non-conformit\u00e9 aux algorithmes de consensus, le validateur est sanctionn\u00e9 via la suppression d\u2019une partie ou de la totalit\u00e9 des $TAL bloqu\u00e9 sur celui-ci. Ce m\u00e9canisme permet ainsi de d\u00e9courager les acteurs belliqueux. A contrario, le respect et les bonnes performances sont r\u00e9compens\u00e9s par la blockchain. Il y a actuellement 100 places de disponible pour les validateurs. Afin d'\u00eatre \u00e9lus par le r\u00e9seau et ainsi cr\u00e9er de nouveau blocs, les validateurs doivent \u00eatre dans les 100 premiers en termes de $TAL bloqu\u00e9 (validateur + nominations). Si un validateur n\u2019est pas \u00e9lu par le r\u00e9seau, il ne proc\u00e9dera \u00e0 aucun travail et ne recevra aucune r\u00e9compense. En contrepartie de leur contribution, les validateurs re\u00e7oivent les r\u00e9compenses du bloc (nouveau $TAL cr\u00e9\u00e9, bas\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me d\u2019inflation fourni par le r\u00e9seau) ainsi que 20% des frais de transaction (le reste allant \u00e0 la tr\u00e9sorerie). Ces r\u00e9compenses sont r\u00e9parties entre le validateur et ses nominateurs en fonction de leurs parts respectives (moins la commission fix\u00e9 par le validateur afin de couvrir les frais de maintenance) 4.2 Nominateur Les nominateurs sont responsables de la d\u00e9signation de leur participation aupr\u00e8s des validateurs. En bloquant leurs $TAL sur des validateurs, ils permettent \u00e0 ceux-ci d'\u00eatre choisi par le r\u00e9seau afin de cr\u00e9er des nouveaux blocs et partagent ainsi les r\u00e9compenses et les p\u00e9nalit\u00e9s associ\u00e9es. Alors que les validateurs sont des participants actifs du r\u00e9seau qui prennent part aux m\u00e9canismes de production et de finalit\u00e9 des blocs, les nominateurs jouent un r\u00f4le plus passif avec une approche de d\u00e9l\u00e9gation. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir des connaissances techniques ou de poss\u00e9der du mat\u00e9riel sp\u00e9cifique. Cependant, un bon nominateur fait preuve de sagesse \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des validateurs qu\u2019il choisit en faisant attention \u00e0 son propre pourcentage de r\u00e9compense ainsi qu\u2019au risque d'\u00eatre sanctionn\u00e9 si le validateur agit de mani\u00e8re belliqueuse. Les nominateurs sont r\u00e9compens\u00e9 en fonction du nombre de part qu\u2019ils d\u00e9tiennent sur le validateur (moins les frais de commission) 5. La Factory La factory est un composant essentiel de l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Galital, il permet entre autres de cr\u00e9er et d\u00e9ployer de mani\u00e8re simple et rapide ses propres NFTs. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un design d'interface ergonomique, cr\u00e9er des NFTs devient un jeu d\u2019enfant et \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tous. Que vous soyez artiste, cr\u00e9ateur de contenu, d\u00e9veloppeur de JV ou passionn\u00e9e, la factory est faite pour vous simplifier la vie et vous faire gagner un temps pr\u00e9cieux, vous permettant de cr\u00e9er \u00e0 l'infinie, en un claquement de doigts. Il sera \u00e9galement possible, lors de la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un NFT, de choisir un % de royalties qui seront pay\u00e9 au cr\u00e9ateur pour chaque transaction du dit NFT dans le market de Galital. Ce syst\u00e8me permettra aux cr\u00e9ateurs de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019un revenu suppl\u00e9mentaire leur incitant \u00e0 partager leurs cr\u00e9ations. 6. Le Hub (Les bridges entre cha\u00eenes + UI) Le Hub est l\u2019espace d\u00e9di\u00e9 pour les bridges cross-cha\u00eene. C\u2019est ici que les utilisateurs vont pouvoir transf\u00e9rer leur NFTs entre les diff\u00e9rentes cha\u00eenes support\u00e9es par Galital (la liste \u00e9voluera en fonction des choix de la communaut\u00e9). Dans un premier temps, les transferts depuis et vers Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Polkadot, Matic et Flare seront disponibles. Permettant ainsi au utilisateur de pouvoir transf\u00e9rer librement leur NFT pour pouvoir les utiliser directement dans l'\u00e9cosyst\u00e8me Galital et notamment le market. Le transfert et le flow s'effectue simplement, l\u2019utilisateur aura une interface graphique ou il pourra s\u00e9lectionner la chaine d\u2019origine et la cha\u00eene de destination pour le transfert des NFTs ou de token, l\u2019utilisateur signe ensuite la transaction est proc\u00e9d\u00e9e par le r\u00e9seau d\u2019oracles ( Galital utilisera la technologie de ChainSafe ), et transfert les assets sur la cha\u00eene d\u00e9sir\u00e9e. 7. Le Market Le market est le point central de Galital, c\u2019est ici que les utilisateurs pourront vendre ou acheter des NFTs. La force du market repose sur sa simplicit\u00e9 d\u2019utilisation et sa diversit\u00e9, il sera possible au vendeur de choisir la crypto qu\u2019il souhaite recevoir en paiement et l\u2019acheteur pourra payer dans la crypto de son choix, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un syst\u00e8me de DEX int\u00e9grer, les achats seront fluides, fini le temps ou il vous fallait convertir vos ETH en DAI car le NFT de votre choix n'\u00e9tait list\u00e9 que en DAI. Fini les gas fee exorbitant, votre achat se fait d\u00e9sormais en un clic et vous pouvez alors acheter vos NFTs quand vous le souhaitez, rapidement et en toute simplicit\u00e9. Lors d\u2019une vente, 2 frais sont d\u00e9duit de la vente : Les fees pour le market : 2.5% Les fees pour le cr\u00e9ateur : d\u00e9fini par celui-ci lors de la cr\u00e9ation du NFT. Les frais du market peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9duit lors d\u2019un paiement en $TAL ainsi qu\u2019en possession de NFT sp\u00e9ciaux. Cumul\u00e9 il peuvent m\u00eame atteindre une r\u00e9duction de 100%. Cependant, les fee pour le cr\u00e9ateur ne peuvent eux pas \u00eatre r\u00e9duit. Les utilisateurs ont \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une vente priv\u00e9e (le NFT ne peut \u00eatre achet\u00e9 que par l'adresse sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e par le vendeur). Dans ce cas, uniquement les frais pour le cr\u00e9ateur sont d\u00e9duits. 8. Le Vault Le vault est l\u2019endroit id\u00e9al pour stacker ses NFTs afin de farmer des nouveaux tokens. Que ce soit pour gagner des monnaies en jeu ou d\u2019autres crypto, le vault vous permet de bloquer vos NFTs pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode afin de les faire travailler eux aussi. 9. Fractional NFT System Galital a l'intention de mettre en \u0153uvre un syst\u00e8me de NFT fractionn\u00e9 afin de pousser les NFTS au-del\u00e0 de leurs limites et de d\u00e9bloquer de nombreuses nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s. Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fractionn\u00e9e (Sharding) Le NFT fractionn\u00e9 (ou le \"Sharding\") permet de partager la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des NFT. Vous voulez une \u00e9p\u00e9e epique dans un jeu mais vous ne pouvez pas vous la payer ? Ou peut-\u00eatre qu'un Cyberpunk attire votre attention depuis longtemps mais il est bien trop cher pour l'acheter seul ? Le NFT fractionn\u00e9 vous permettra de prendre une part sur ces NFT. C'est encore plus utile lorsque vous voulez profiter des avantages de la DeFi grace au NFT. En effet, ce system vous permet de prendre des parts fractionn\u00e9es afin de percevoir un revenu via le syst\u00e8me de pr\u00eat, vous permettant ainsi de beneficier de tous les avantages de la DeFi assoic\u00e9s aux NFTs. Ce syst\u00e8me offre de nombreuses possiblit\u00e9s qui vont bien au-del\u00e0 de ce document. Si vous \u00eates un joueur de MMO, vous voudrez certainement l'utiliser pour acheter des NFTs en tant que guilde et les partager avec vos membres. Plus loin encore, les d\u00e9veloppeurs de jeux pourraient d\u00e9velopper des contrats intelligents qui permettront aux guildes de poss\u00e9der un NFT et de le partager automatiquement avec les membres de celle-ci en fonction de leur rang. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 \u00e7a, vous pourrez d\u00e9sormais poss\u00e9der un NFT en tant que guilde, le louer ou le vendre et tout cela sera partag\u00e9 entre tous les membres. Vous pouvez aussi simplement partager un NFT avec vos amis ou votre communaut\u00e9 et l'utiliser en jeu chacun votre tour. C'est un grand pas en avant pour l'industrie du jeu et offre de nombreuses possiblit\u00e9s de jouer , poss\u00e9der et gagner ensemble. D\u00e9couverte des prix du march\u00e9 Le \"Sharding\" permettra \u00e9galement d'am\u00e9liorer et de rendre plus saine la d\u00e9couverte du prix des NFTs. Les \"shards\" seront directement driv\u00e9 par le march\u00e9 et \u00e9chang\u00e9es comme n'importe quel token. Si un utilisateur veut prendre la pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un NFT fractionn\u00e9, il lui suffira d'obtenir toutes les \"shards\" de celui-ci afin d'\u00eatre en mesure de le reformer grace \u00e0 la forge. Il sera \u00e9galement possible \u00e0 tout moment de casser un NFT en n'importe quel nombre de \"Shards\" permettant ainsi de donner plus raret\u00e9 \u00e0 un seul NFT. 10. La forge La forge est l'endroit id\u00e9al pour casser ses NFTs en \u00e9clats (ou \"Shards\"). Il est possible de choisir la raret\u00e9 (le nombre de shards produit : 10, 100, 1000, etc..). Ensuite, les \"Shards\" peuvent \u00eatre distribu\u00e9 ou vendu via le Market comme un token. Cela donnera par exemple la possibilit\u00e9 aux cr\u00e9ateurs de jeux vid\u00e9o d'am\u00e9liorer la raret\u00e9 de leur NFT tout en permettant \u00e0 un plus grand nombre de personnes d'y acceder. Lorsque vous avez collect\u00e9 tous les \"Shards\" d'un NFT, vous pouvez aller sur la forge et les fusionner afin de reformer le NFT original. 11. Pr\u00eater / Emprunter En plus de simplifier consid\u00e9rablement l'achat et la vente de NFTS, le march\u00e9 permettra \u00e9galement aux utilisateurs de louer ou pr\u00eater leurs NFT. Vous souhaitez obtenir un objet de valeur dans un jeu pour un certain temps ? Vous poss\u00e9dez des terres que vous aimeriez mettre \u00e0 disposition ? Un ami a besoin d'un NFT en votre possession temporairement ? Le march\u00e9 vous permettra d'effectuer toutes ces actions et bien plus encore, de mani\u00e8re simple et s\u00e9curis\u00e9e. Plus besoin d'envoyer vorte NFT pour le pr\u00eater. Un nouveau champ de possiblit\u00e9s s'offre a vous avec Galital. 12. Le Home Le home fait office de dashboard pour g\u00e9rer vos NFTs. C\u2019est ici que vous aurez la possibilit\u00e9 de voir vos NFTs, g\u00e9rer vos assets c\u2019est votre panneau de contr\u00f4le principal. De cet emplacement vous pourrez g\u00e9rer toutes les applications, cr\u00e9er des tokens, acheter / vendre sur le marketplace. 13. Contracts int\u00e9ligents \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Substrate prend en charge les contrats intelligents Wasm, cela signifie que tout langage pouvant compiler vers Wasm peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour \u00e9crire ces contrats. ink! est la r\u00e9ponse de Parity pour r\u00e9diger des contrats intelligents en utilisant le langage de programmation Rust. ink! est un langage sp\u00e9cifique au domaine int\u00e9gr\u00e9 (eDSL) bas\u00e9 sur Rust pour la r\u00e9daction de contrats intelligents Wasm sp\u00e9cifiquement pour la \u201cContrats pallet\u201d. Les principaux objectifs de INK! sont la convivialit\u00e9, la concision et l'efficacit\u00e9. 13.1 Composants du contrat ink! devrait se sentir familier aux d\u00e9veloppeurs qui ont programm\u00e9 en utilisant d'autres langages de contrat intelligents modernes. Le squelette d'un contrat \u00e0 tous les m\u00eames composants auquel vous pourriez vous attendre: \u00c9v\u00e9nements Espace de stockage Fonction de d\u00e9ploiement (constructeur) Fonctions publiques Fonctions internes Dans ink !, la mutabilit\u00e9 et la visibilit\u00e9 sont explicitement d\u00e9finies par fonction de contrat. Dans ces fonctions, vous avez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un certain nombre de types de Substrate courants tels que AccountId, Balances, Hash, etc. De plus, vous avez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des variables d'environnement couramment utilis\u00e9es comme l'appelant, et plus encore! 13.2 Design Les principaux objectifs de ink! sont l'exactitude, la concision et l'efficacit\u00e9. inking! est con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre aussi proche que possible du langage de programmation Rust. Le langage utilise des macros d'attributs pour baliser les structures Rust standard en composants de contrat compr\u00e9hensibles. Parce que ink! suit les normes Rust, des outils comme rustfmt et rust-analyzer fonctionnent d\u00e9j\u00e0 nativement. 13.3 S\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019overflow \u00catre \u00e9crit en Rust, INK! peut fournir une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de d\u00e9passement / sous-d\u00e9passement lors de la compilation. \u00c0 l'aide d'une configuration de compilateur Rust, vous pouvez sp\u00e9cifier si vous souhaitez prendre en charge les d\u00e9bordements math\u00e9matiques ou si vous voulez que l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat panique en cas de d\u00e9passement. Pas besoin d'importer continuellement des biblioth\u00e8ques \"Safe Math\", bien que Rust propose \u00e9galement des fonctions math\u00e9matiques v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es, encapsul\u00e9es et satur\u00e9es int\u00e9gr\u00e9es. Remarque: il existe des probl\u00e8mes connus concernant la fonctionnalit\u00e9 des v\u00e9rifications de d\u00e9passement de capacit\u00e9 au niveau du compilateur et la taille r\u00e9sultante de l'objet blob Wasm. Cette fonctionnalit\u00e9 peut changer ou \u00eatre r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avenir. 13.4 Environnement de test INK! fournit un environnement de test int\u00e9gr\u00e9 qui peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 pour effectuer des tests unitaires hors cha\u00eene avec le framework Rust. Cela permet de garantir simplement et facilement que votre code de contrat fonctionne comme pr\u00e9vu, sans avoir besoin de plates-formes de test tierces. 13.4 ink! vs Solidity Rust est un langage de contrat intelligent id\u00e9al. Il est de type s\u00e9curis\u00e9, sans danger pour la m\u00e9moire et exempt de comportements ind\u00e9finis. Il g\u00e9n\u00e8re de petits fichiers binaires car il n'inclut pas de ballonnement suppl\u00e9mentaire, comme un garbage collector, et les optimisations avanc\u00e9es et supprime le code mort. Gr\u00e2ce aux indicateurs du compilateur, Rust peut se prot\u00e9ger automatiquement contre le d\u00e9passement d'entier. INK! choisit de ne pas inventer un nouveau langage de programmation, mais plut\u00f4t d'adapter un sous-ensemble de Rust pour servir cet objectif.

You may choose whatever VPS providers that your prefer, and whatever operating system you are comfortable with. The transactions weights in Galital Testnet were benchmarked on standard hardware. It is recommended that validators run at least the standard hardware in order to ensure they are able to process all blocks in time. The following are not minimum requirements but if you decide to run with less than this beware that you might have performance issue. Minimum Hardware : 6GB ram, 60 GB Storage, 2 CPU , stable server uplink connection with fixed IP Ideal Hardware : 60GB ram, 300 GB Storage, 6 CPU, stable server uplink connection with fixed IP Using Ubuntu 20.04 : Update your Ubuntu sudo apt-get update Validator Install & Configure Network Time Protocol (NTP) Client NTP is a networking protocol designed to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network. NTP allows you to synchronize the clocks of all the systems within the network. Currently it is required that validators' local clocks stay reasonably in sync, so you should be running NTP or a similar service. You can check whether you have the NTP client by running: If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 / 19.04 / 20.04, NTP Client should be installed by default. timedatectl If NTP is installed and running, you should see System clock synchronized: yes (or a similar message). If you do not see it, you can install it by executing: sudo apt-get install ntp ntpd will be started automatically after install. You can query ntpd for status information to verify that everything is working: sudo ntpq -p WARNING: Skipping this can result in the validator node missing block authorship opportunities. If the clock is out of sync (even by a small amount), the blocks the validator produces may not get accepted by the network.
